## Features Details

### Job Title Modes

The application offers two distinct modes for managing job titles in Step 3:

#### üìã Use Existing Job Titles Mode
- **Purpose**: Keep and edit existing job titles from the loaded Excel file
- **Behavior**:
  - Job titles remain as they are in the source file
  - Edit job titles as free text (no restrictions)
  - Bulk assignment uses text input
  - Add Single User form uses text input
  - Best for: Minor edits, retaining current structure

#### üéØ Assign New Roles Mode
- **Purpose**: Standardize job titles by assigning from a predefined list of roles
- **Behavior**:
  - All existing job titles are cleared when this mode is selected
  - Define at least one role before proceeding (can add multiple)
  - Job Title column becomes a dropdown in the table
  - Bulk assignment shows role dropdown with "Custom" option
  - Add Single User form shows role dropdown with "Custom" option
  - Best for: Standardization, ensuring consistency, tender requirements

#### Switching Modes
- Mode can be changed at any time using "üîÑ Change Mode" button
- **Warning**: Switching from "Assign New Roles" back to "Use Existing" will retain the assigned roles as text
- Switching from "Use Existing" to "Assign New Roles" will clear all job titles
- Defined roles are preserved when switching modes

#### Custom Option
- When in "Assign New Roles" mode, "Custom" option is always available
- Select "Custom" to enter a job title that's not in the defined roles list
- Useful for exceptions or one-off positions
- Custom entries are saved as-is (not added to defined roles list)

### Auto-Save System
- First edit creates timestamped file in `temp_uploads/`
- Subsequent edits overwrite the same file
- Saves after every change:
  - Table edits
  - User additions
  - Bulk assignments
  - Row deletions

### Search Logic
- **Role Name**: Matches against "Job Title" (case-insensitive, contains)
- **Qualification Keywords**: OR logic (matches ANY keyword, not all)
- **Experience Filter**: Minimum threshold (greater than or equal to)
- **Diploma Filter**: Include/exclude based on "Diploma" keyword in qualifications

### CV Generation Algorithm
1. For each employee:
   - Parse employee's From/To dates
   - Find all projects that overlap with employee tenure
   - Randomly select ONE eligible project
   - Avoid duplicate project assignments (when possible)
   - Use employee's From/To dates in CV (not project dates)
   - Display "Present" for To date
   - Include project description as bullet points

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Job Title Mode**: Choose "Assign New Roles" for standardization, "Use Existing" for flexibility
2. **Define Roles Early**: If using "Assign New Roles", define all roles before editing personnel
3. **Custom Option**: Use "Custom" sparingly - defeats the purpose of standardization
4. **Date Entry**: Always use MM-YYYY format (e.g., 01-2020) for consistency
5. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple rows for faster editing, especially useful with role dropdowns
6. **Search Strategy**: Start with broad criteria, then refine
7. **Qualification Keywords**: Use comma-separated list for OR logic
8. **Auto-Save**: Changes save automatically, but download Excel for backup
9. **Empty Rows**: Don't worry about empty rows, they're auto-removed
10. **Format Warnings**: Non-blocking, you can save and fix later
11. **Project Assignment**: Random but timeline-aware (ensures logical CVs)
12. **Mode Switching**: Be cautious when switching modes - job titles may be cleared

## Troubleshooting

### Files Not Loading
- Check file paths in configuration
- Ensure Excel files are not open in another program
- Verify sheet names match configuration

### Date Format Issues
- Use MM-YYYY format: `01-2020`, `11-2022`
- Avoid spaces, special characters
- Year must be 4 digits

### Search Returns No Results
- Check if personnel data is loaded
- Verify keyword spelling
- Try "Contains" mode instead of "Exact Word"
- Lower minimum experience requirement

### Cannot Download or Generate CVs
- **Check validation results**: Click on "üîç Data Validation Results" expander
- **Critical Issues (Must Fix)**:
  - **Missing Names**: Add names to all rows with empty Name field
  - **Missing Job Titles**: Assign job titles to all personnel
    - In "Use Existing" mode: Type job title directly
    - In "Assign New Roles" mode: Select from dropdown or choose "Custom"
    - Use bulk assignment tool for multiple rows at once
  - **Missing Qualifications**: Add qualifications to all rows
  - **Missing From Dates**: Add start dates in MM-YYYY format (e.g., 01-2020)
- **How to Find Issues**:
  - Validation report shows affected row numbers and names
  - Shows first 10 affected rows, indicates if more exist
  - Look for warning banner above table with missing field counts
  - Check metrics: "Job Titles Assigned" shows X/Total
- **Quick Fix Tips**:
  - Select multiple rows ‚Üí Use bulk assignment
  - Add missing data directly in table
  - Delete completely empty rows if not needed

### CV Generation Fails
- Ensure project info file is loaded
- Check project date columns exist
- Verify at least some personnel data exists
- Ensure all job titles are assigned (check validation)
